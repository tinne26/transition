# Ebitengine 2023 game jam entry

Completely incomplete game. Published only because why not.

```
go run github.com/tinne26/transition@latest
```

## Controls

Explained in game, but there's also `F` to fullscreen, and you can actually use most gamepads to some extent too, even if you won't know what buttons to use.

## TODO

I don't know if I'll do anything, the code is super messy, but I like the concept and the narrative that I didn't get to develop. No spoilers.
